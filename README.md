Rainbow Drift is Moosepark Studio's debut racing video game, made with custom-crafted 3D models, UI textures, and audio-tracks. 

This game was 2+ years in the making with lots of redesigns in between. You can check out the company website [here](https://mooseparkstudios.net/) for a better overview of the game's development.

## How to run
Unfortunately, Unity project files are enormous (330+ MB) and Github doesn't let us upload many of the massive assets we have designed for the game. Without these assets, the Unity project won't be able to build anyways. However, we've included all of the C# scripts we've written for Rainbow Drift for educational purposes. Hopefully, in the near future, we will be able to upload the entire project to the repository for the benefit of the game development community.
